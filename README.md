## Technologies

<li>Python</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Mathlabplot</li>
<li>R</li>

## Description
The following is a repository that contains code for a group project where we were asked to choose a data set, come up with questions to ask about the set, 
and use statistics and data analysis to describe them. Each folder matches a corresponding question, and the questions are located below.

## The Questions
<ol>
<li>How many male children compared to female children went missing?</li>
<li>What is average age of a kid reported missing? (SD? Median?)</li> 
<li>What is the State with the most missing children and compare it to the population?</li> 
<li>What is percentage of kids that go missing on holidays compared to non-holidays? Do some holidays historically have more missing cases? How about the week following holidays?</li> 
<li>What is the percentage of teenagers who are minorities that are gone missing?</li> 
<li>What is the average height of teenager who are gone missing?</li>
</ol>

## How to run the code
In order to reproduce our results you need to make sure you have the technologies described at the top of this page installed on your machine. If you do not, you can 
easily install them using pip or however you install your packages. Next, clone the repository by typing the following code into your terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulCardoos/MissingKidDataAnalysis.git
```
Now you can navigate into the folder that contains the code you want to run and simply run it however you run your python code. Enjoy!
