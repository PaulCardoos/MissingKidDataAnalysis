A deceased baby girl infant was found inside the backpack. It?s estimated the infant had been deceased less than 24 hours. Forensic testing suggests she was Hispanic. Authorities identified a medication in her blood that treats epileptic seizures or different mood disorders in adults. It is believed that the infant?s mother was taking this medication during pregnancy. The level detected was a standard prescribed amount.  Inside the backpack authorities also found a red bath towel, a brown bathmat and matching brown toilet seat cover. Pollen testing of the evidence suggest that the items spent a significant amount of time in an urban area of Northern Illinois and possibly originated in the Southwest United States before coming to Illinois.

The remains were found in the water at Buckhorn Reservoir. It?s estimated that he had been deceased for several years, likely longer than 3 years. An anthropologist examined the remains and stated they belonged to a Caucasian, possibly Hispanic male, 17-22 years old that stood approximately 5?5? tall. His hair and eye color are unknown. The male?s nose appeared slightly crooked and may have tilted to the right. Characteristics of the leg bones suggested he may have had some type of gait disturbance. The male?s lower jaw was not recovered. An exam of the upper teeth suggested that he may have endured some type of trauma to his face prior to his death that formed an abscess behind his front upper teeth. This may have caused him some pain or discomfort. The male was found wearing Levi Straus blue jeans, size 30M with a belt that had a white metal buckle.
